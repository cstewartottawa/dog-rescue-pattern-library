The buttons use our secondary colour to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

• The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light colour.
• The light buttons are for dark background areas.
• The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image.

Use the different 'font-size' classes to generate sizes of buttons.
